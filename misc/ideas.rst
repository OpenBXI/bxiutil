Project
----------

- Write a notebook to describe various features 

     - bxirng, 
     - bximap,
     - bxivector, 
     - bxistretch, ...


Interface
------------

- bxirng: provide a way to specify a global seed so that a
  multithreaded program have a deterministic behavior regarding the
  sequence of pseudo-random generated for each thread. Concrete
  example is bxirouting uses an RNG per thread to compute routing
  tables.  Given a single seed, one would like to have exactly the
  same routing tables generated.


Implementation
